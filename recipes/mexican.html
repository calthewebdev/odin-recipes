            <ul>
                <li>½ (16 ounce) can spicy fat-free refried beans*</li>
                <li>1 cup salsa, divided</li>
                <li>1 (12 inch) pre-baked Italian pizza crust</li>
                <li>2 cups shredded hearts of romaine lettuce</li>
                <li>3 medium green onions, thinly sliced</li>
                <li>¼ cup ranch dressing</li>
                <li>¼ cup crumbled tortilla chips</li>
                <li>1 cup shredded pepper Jack or Monterey Jack cheese</li>
            </ul>
            <h3><b>Steps</b></h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Adjust oven rack to lowest position, and heat oven to 450 degrees. Mix beans and 1/2 cup salsa in a medium bowl. Place crust on a cookie sheet, then spread the bean mixture over crust. Bake until it's crisp and warm, about 10 minutes.</li>
                <li>Remove from oven; top with lettuce, green onions and dollop with the remaining salsa. Drizzle (or, if dressing has an easy-pour top, squirt) dressing over pizza. Top with chips and cheese, then return to oven and bake until the cheese melts, about 2 minutes longer. Cut into 6 slices and serve.</li>
